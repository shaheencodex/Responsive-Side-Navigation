            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

            <h1>HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front End Languages</h1>
            <p>Three of the most important “front end” languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These all have specific uses, and all three are used to design websites. They help define form, function, and style – and are all necessary skills to become web developer.
            </p>

<p>This is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. HTML, or “HyperText Markup Language,” has been around in some form since roughly 1993, when it was created by physicist Tim Berners-Lee. It’s now in its fifth generation, HTML5.
HTML isn’t a programming language, rather it’s a “Markup language.” It uses a syntax of tags to change the way text is displayed, for instance. It can also define where images go on a page.
What’s great is that HTML is relatively simple to learn. It provides a great place to start for people who don’t have experience with programming languages to learn the basics of coding.
</p>

<p>CSS or “Cascading Style Sheets” works with HTML to create the format for web pages. It works on top of the foundation of a page that was created with HTML. It also helps adapt pages to different formats optimized for desktops or mobile devices. The latest standard is CSS3, meaning they are in their third generation.CSS is what gives websites their polished and professional look. It also allows for the addition of interactive elements like background color, headers, shapes, graphics, and more that make websites and web applications much more engaging to the viewer.</p>

<p>JavaScript, which is often abbreviated to JS, is another front-end programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries like JQuery. Whereas HTML & CSS are used to control presentation, formatting, and layout, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different web elements. 
 It is important to learn HTML and CSS before learning JavaScript, since HTML and CSS are the core technologies for building web pages and applications. HTML defines the structure of your content, CSS determines the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content interactive; therefore, it makes the most sense to learn them in that order. JavaScript incorporates valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming.</p>
